# Final Project: HTML+SASS/Bootstrap
**Due date:** Nov 10th (Friday)

## Overview
For this project, you will create a landing page. Take a look at this [link](https://unbounce.com/landing-pages/elements-of-a-winning-landing-page/) for inspiration and ideas.

## Instructions
- Create an HTML with SASS or Bootstrap landing page for any type of imaginary business. It could be a product promotion, product details, or a company website.
- Only use SASS or Bootstrap for your CSS infrastructure.
- All of your style selectors/properties must be defined in the CSS file. You will lose points for any style properties defined in the HTML file. (unless you're using TailwindCSS)
- Ensure the landing page is responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Use new HTML5 elements.
- Pay attention to SEO best practices for HTML5 structures. Refer to this [slide](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/20-html-best-practices-you-should-follow/).

### Optional
- Provide wireframes from your planning stage.
- You can use TailwindCSS.
- Deploy your website to any free web hosting service you prefer (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
- JavaScript is optional since we have not covered the HTML DOM tree.
